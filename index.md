# UxStyle

### About

UxStyle is a bit of software that relaxes Windows theme signature requirements to enable third-party customization.
Specifically, UxStyle consists of a tiny system service and a kernel driver that are loaded into memory where they
hang out until reboot. No file system changes are made.

(First introduced on March 19, 2009.)
