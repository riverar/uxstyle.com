## About

UxStyle is a bit of software that tricks the Windows operating system into thinking
third party themes are signed by Microsoft. Specifically, UxStyle consists of a tiny system service and a kernel driver
that are loaded into memory where they hang out until reboot. No file system changes are made.

(First introduced on March 19, 2009.)
