# UxStyle

### About

UxStyle is a bit of software that relaxes Windows theme signature requirements to enable third-party customization.
Specifically, UxStyle consists of a tiny system service and a kernel driver that are loaded into memory where they
hang out until reboot. No file system changes are made.

(First introduced on March 19, 2009.)

UxStyle was recently rebranded to UxStyle Community Edition and published to GitHub under the [GPL license](https://github.com/riverar/uxstyle/blob/master/LICENSE).
